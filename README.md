> Demonstrates the phishing detection, result export, dark mode toggle, and URL scanning features.


## 🧠 How It Works

The detector analyzes URLs using rule-based heuristics:

- Detects usage of http:// instead of https://
- Flags long URLs or those with excessive subdomains
- Checks for common phishing keywords (login, free, verify, etc.)
- Identifies suspicious patterns like hyphens in the domain

If 2 or more rules match, the URL is marked as *⚠ Phishing Detected*.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (Standard Python GUI Library)
- csv and webbrowser modules
